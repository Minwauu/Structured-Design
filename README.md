# Structured-Design

### Quickfire Five

**What is the difference between an indefinite and a definite iteration?** - Definite is where the amount of loops can be predicted or is known beforehand whereas with indefinite it is unknown and continues until a condition is met.

**Which sequence is generated by this recurrence relation?** - The Fibonacci sequence.

**Why is understanding stack frames relevant to understanding the usefulness of recursion?** - Stack frames generate every time there is a recursive call which takes up memory and time.

**What is a datum? Give some examples of how a datum could be interpreted.** - A singular piece of data, represented by a series of bits. E.g characters

## Programming paradigms and structured design

- A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas.
- To design is to plan or mark out the form and method of solution. 


Structured design is a disciplined process of deciding which components interconnected in which way will solve some well-specified problem. 

A problem is divided into smaller and smaller sub problems, so that each sub problem will eventually correspond to a component of the system which solves the problem. 

The partitioning process into smaller and smaller sub problems is done until the sub problems are:

- manageably small and
- solveable separately i.e relatively independent of one another

A **good** design is an exercise in partitioning and organising the pieces of the system so that each is **cohesive** and **loosely coupled**. (The pieces of the system are referred to as **modules** or **units** or **components** and can be implemented with subroutines.

### Cohesion

**Cohesion** measures the strength of the interconnection between elements within a module. To achieve cohesion, highly interrelated parts of the real-world problem should be in the same piece of the software system, i.e things that belong together should go together.

To minimalise coupling among modules:

- Subroutines or modules should only be allowed to access that data which they need to perform their assigned task
- All data transfer between modules is visible in the module parameters
- There must be no hidden flows of data via global variables or shared data areas
- There should be no control information passing between modules, e.g Boolean flags
- The number of module parameters should be minimal
