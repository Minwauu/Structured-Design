### Quickfire Five

**What is the difference between an indefinite and a definite iteration?** - Definite is where the amount of loops can be predicted or is known beforehand whereas with indefinite it is unknown and continues until a condition is met.

**Which sequence is generated by this recurrence relation?** - The Fibonacci sequence.

**Why is understanding stack frames relevant to understanding the usefulness of recursion?** - Stack frames generate every time there is a recursive call which takes up memory and time.

**What is a datum? Give some examples of how a datum could be interpreted.** - A singular piece of data, represented by a series of bits. E.g characters

## Programming paradigms
